# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Layout: single-context

This repo is **single-context**: one `GLOSSARY.md` at the repo root, shared by the whole repository, and architecture decisions in `doc/adr/`.

Concretely: no `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` and no per-subproject `GLOSSARY.md` exist, and none should be created until the first real glossary entry is actually written. Create them lazily, not speculatively — the same rule that governs the files below.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`GLOSSARY.md`** at the repo root (single-context: this is the only glossary).
- **`doc/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (this repo):

```
/
├── GLOSSARY.md
├── doc/
│   ├── adr/
│   │   ├── 0001-event-sourced-orders.md
│   │   └── 0002-postgres-for-write-model.md
│   └── agents/
│       ├── issue-tracker.md
│       ├── triage-labels.md
│       └── domain.md
└── lib/
```

Multi-context is **not** in use here. For reference, it would mean a root `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` pointing at one `GLOSSARY.md` per context, with context-scoped ADRs in `src/<context>/doc/adr/`. If this repo ever grows into that shape, switch by writing the map file and updating this section — the skills decide which layout they're in by the presence of `GLOSSARY-MAP.md` at the root.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `GLOSSARY.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal: either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders), but worth reopening because…_
